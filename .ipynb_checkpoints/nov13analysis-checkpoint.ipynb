    "# Introduction\n",
    "The following is an analysis of the network involved in the terror plots, as drawn from open media sources.  As more data would become available, this information will be updated.\n",
    "The focus of the analysis is \n",
    "- provide a succint summary of the attacks\n",
    "- provide a dataset for further research\n",
    "- understand how different types of relationships may have helped organizing the plots\n",
    "- understand the structure of the network, representing one of the largest plots by The Islamic State group\n",
    "\n",
    "There is still considerable uncertainty about the network.  In part, some of the individuals are still at large;  many have been arrested but little of their identities was revealed in the media."

    "# Methods\n",
    "Data from media sources was organized in a graphical event database (Neo4j version: 2.2.5).  This database is a multimodal network and contains:\n",
    "1. the individuals involved in the attack\n",
    "2. any persons connected to this plot as possible accessories\n",
    "3. locations such as countries and staging sites\n",
    "4. the individual attack sites\n",
    "\n",
    "From the database, we constructed the social network representing the connections between Daesh operatives.  There is actually a considerable debate as to the definition of terrorism, and the process of drawing terrorist networks.  In this case, we followed a strict computational procedure (see source code below for the calculation steps).  Briefly, the network has been structured by starting from seed persons, defined as either the attackers or wanted individuals (the attackers are the people who used weapons on the November 13 attacks.)  Additional individuals were added to the network by going outward from the these seeds.  It only includes individuals who are suspected of terrorist activities or may have known about them through previous links to the seed attackers.  The links include familiar, friendship or shared residence.   "
